# Altered Stats
A plugin that shows any stats that are altered from their current base level. This only tracks hard level changes (such as boosts from potions and loss of prayer due to usage) and not invisible boosts (like the celestial ring).

Much of the logic was copied from the combat-information plugin (https://github.com/KMPLX-KODE/combat-information) and effective-level plugin (https://github.com/XrioBtw/effective-level) - a big thank you to the open source community for allowing me to create this plugin!
